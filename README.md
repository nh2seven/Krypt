# Krypt
- Krypt is an entirely local/offline password manager built using Python and SQLite, with encryption and decryption mechanisms in place for better security.
- With Krypt, you can store all your passwords and/or credentials safely, without the risk of ever exposing yourself to the internet.
- At the moment, Krypt is still in active rapid development. Contributions are welcome.

# Features
- Multi-user system that stores credentials independent of user.
- Elevated admin access for routine/moderation tasks.
- Logging of system activities to track user activity and potentially identify rare cases of unauthorized access.
- Storage of user credentials along with associated websites, tags, descriptions and individual keys if enabled.
- (To be updated later.)
